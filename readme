# Jango Aano?
The project is a binary image classifier to classy images of mango and jackfruit, also it can detect whether the image is neither of the two. it returns the output with a decent accuracy. We did the project using pytorch in google colab . We have used images downloaded from google images and kaggle after saving it in our google drive. We have used a simple Lenet 5 based CNN architecture to imp-lement the model
