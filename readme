# Jango Aano?
The project is a binary image classifier to classy images of mango and jackfruit, also it can detect whether the image is neither of the two. 
it returns the output with a decent accuracy.We did the project using pytorch in google colab.
We have used images downloaded from google images and kaggle after saving it in our google drive. 
The link for dataset from google drive:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BzkwvN86s5fE2Mxhz6jFq6Bq2_8XPwdA?usp=sharing
We have used a simple Lenet 5 based CNN architecture to implement the model.It has 5 layers - 2 convolution and maxpool layers and 3 fully connected layers.The trained model is saved to derive. 
The pretrained model saved in derive is obtained hosted as a url
